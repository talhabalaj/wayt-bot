# WAYT - WhatsApp YouTube Bot
A WhatsApp bot where you can send names of songs and it will download, convert and send you a mp3 file. It works by utilizing the [Twilio](www.twilio.com/referral/EdcIGC) WhatsApp Buiness API, [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core) for downloading and a [custom build](https://github.com/talhabalaj/ffmpeg-static-libshine-only) of ffmpeg for conversion.

# Why a WhatsApp bot?
Basically, don't know about other countries but in Pakistan ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°, We have Social bundles meaning data that can just be used on social networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. These bundles are real cheap, everyone has these and to an extent they are must have for University students like me. The idea is using that data for download songs while I'm in bus waiting to get home.
