# WAYT - WhatsApp YouTube Bot
A WhatsApp bot where you can send names of songs, it will download, convert, and send you an mp3 file. It works by utilizing the [Twilio](www.twilio.com/referral/EdcIGC) WhatsApp Business API, [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core) for downloading, and a [custom build](https://github.com/talhabalaj/ffmpeg-static-libshine-only) of FFmpeg for conversion.

# Why a WhatsApp bot?
Don't know about other countries but in Pakistan ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°, We have Social bundles meaning data that can only be used on social networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. These bundles are real cheap, everyone has these and to an extent, they are must-have for University students like me. The idea is to use that data to download songs while I'm on the bus waiting to get home.
